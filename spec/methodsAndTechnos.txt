Use Test-Driven Development
	- Qt Unit testing framework for the GUI testing
	- Google C++ Testing Framework (Google Testm in short) can help us with that
Re-use existing libraries
	- Qt for the GUI part, and more.
	- Boost (might not be required with Qt)
	- libcurl : uploads, content transfers
	- libopenssl : encryption
	- requests : Secure connection to db? Protocol Buffers + server-side
	  client? + https webservices?
