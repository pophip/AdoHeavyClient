UC5: Reply to a request



Hypothesis:

	→	The user has been requested to upload some content by another
		user



Scenario:

	The user:
	→	sees the e-mail asking him to upload "ContentABCXYZ" on Ado
	→	opens AHC
	→	authenticates himself

	AHC, after succesful authentication:
	→	requests the list of upload requests

	The server:
	→	returns the list of the IDs of the contents requested by other
		users to the user

	AHC:
	→	if the list is not empty (here it is not), displays the upload
		requests page


	It looks like this:


	<meta1>		<meta2>		<meta3>		upload ?
	=================================================
	value11		value12		value13		◻
	value21		value22		value23		◻
	THIS IS		THE ONE		HE WANTS	✓
	value41		value42		value43		◻

							[Upload]	[Cancel]
	

	The user:
	→	ticks the checkbox(es) of the content(s) he wants to upload now
	→	clicks the "Upload" button

	AHC:
	→	checks his local xml to find the path to the content
	→	zips the content in a file with a random-generated name
	→	encrypts the content
	→	establishes an FTP connection to the server
	→	puts the zip file on the server
	→	closes the FTP connection
	→	connects to the webservice of the server using the credentials
		in his config file
	→	sends the content's metadata along with the zip file's md5 and
		filename

	The webservice, upon answering the request:
	→	checks that there is a zip file with the name provided, and its
		md5 checksum
	→	if everything is OK, inserts the metadata into a table in the DB
	→	sends an e-mail to the user who requested the content

	AHC:
	→	if there was no error, closes the connection to the webservice
