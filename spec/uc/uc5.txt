UC5: Request content



Hypothesis:

	→	The user has already opened the client
	→	He is authenticated
	→	He has performed a search OR browsed to a published content (not
		available)



Scenario:

	Here is what his screen would look like:


	<meta1>		<meta2>		<meta3>		actions
	=================================================
	value11		value12		value13		download
	value21		value22		value23		request
	THIS IS		THE ONE		I WANT		request
	value41		value42		value43		download


	/The available content can be downloaded directly./
	/The published content can be requested./


	The user clicks on "request".


	The server:

	→	Stores the ID of the content in the list of the user's download requests
	→	Stores the ID of the content in the list of the user who has
		the content in his upload requests
	→	Sends an e-mail to the user who has the content to ask him to
		upload it
